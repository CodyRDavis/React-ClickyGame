### description
Simple game of memory. 16 characters on the screen. If a character is touched twice in the same round, its game over. see if you can get the high score.

### final thoughts
It was fun workin with react. this was the first time I got to slow down and really try things, fail, and work things out using react. I enjoyed seeing how I could layer states and have stateful elements draw elements that are also stateful.

### things I would like to add down the road.
* winning condition - currently the game eventually ends in a game over. I could compare the currentScore to the length of the character array to see if the user indeed guessed them all.
* even more characters
* internal images. I was having trouble pulling from files I had saved locally. either my path names were bad or I was doing something else wrong. it will need a revisit.
